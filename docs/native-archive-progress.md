# Native archive implementation progress

This is the implementation record for the
[full transition plan](native-archive-transition-plan.md). It does not narrow
that plan's scope or replace its completion criteria. Development remains on
`v3-rewrite`; merge into `develop` requires verification and the owner's success
review. Production has not been migrated.

## Frozen baseline

- Stash source: `0a603d07e9ec3dd9863a7340858a635525bb2c11`, pushed annotated tag
  `v2.5-compatible-final`; primary schema 86, fork schema 9.
- The running binary reports `v0.26.2-1182-g0a603d07e`. Its wrapper index is
  `sha256:b9c30164d591cb9764f809505208fbf7d42d0bfdf209230b94f0dba69b46014b`.
- The local Quadlet now uses that digest and has registry auto-update disabled.
  A daemon reload succeeded; the existing container was not restarted. The
  original Quadlet is retained in the owner's config backup directory under
  `backups/native-archive-baseline-20260930/`.
- The [release manifest](releases/v2.5-compatible-final.json) records all frozen
  image digests. Base-image preservation passed in
  [run 36757532460](https://github.com/notsafeforgit/stash/actions/runs/36757532460),
  including embedded revision and exact manifest-digest checks. Wrapper image
  preservation passed in
  [run 36758167764](https://github.com/notsafeforgit/stash-s6/actions/runs/36758167764)
  for all three variants and their child manifests.

## Phase status

| Phase | Status |
| --- | --- |
| 0 Baseline and contract | In progress: source tagged, runtime pinned, all compatible images preserved, independent-fork policy updated. Full backup boundary, fixtures, scoped API contract and performance budgets remain. |
| 1 Native schema and services | Schema promotion, canonical saved/default filters, durable config import, unified performer names, portable archive identities including galleries and metadata relationship targets, native account/ownership storage and reviewed consolidation, shared post/profile/capture storage, ordered attachment manifests, audited media associations, reviewed source-list selection, and source-gallery synchronization with manual membership intent are implemented. Scalar and relationship field choices protect explicit and preserved metadata. Producer identity matching, policy resolution, review APIs/UI and remaining domain services are in progress. |
| 2 Ingestion and producer adapter | Not yet implemented |
| 3 Catalog importer and full-copy reconciliation | Not yet implemented |
| 4 Native UI and client conversion | Not yet implemented |
| 5 Compatibility removal and packaging | Preview packaging isolated and old compatibility gate replaced by current v3 operation/plugin-contract checks. Old UI/API/plugin adapters and config bridge still require conversion/removal. |
| 6 Backup and cutover rehearsal | Not yet implemented |
| 7 Production cutover | Not started; compatible production continues |
| 8 Retirement and acceptance | Not started |

No live catalog data or Stash schema has been changed. Do not retire existing
writers, mounts, plugin data, or backups until rehearsal and cutover requirements
have passed. Original catalogs and operating state are migration inputs, including
performer merges, UUIDs, explicit unlink decisions, and pending producer work.

## First native schema rehearsal

On 2026-09-30, an online SQLite backup of the running compatible library produced
a 1,071,263,744-byte isolated snapshot in 3.289 seconds. A separate copy promoted
from primary 86 / fork 9 to native 1000000 in 3.207 seconds. This measurement
covers the initial table promotion, not the later catalog import or production
cutover downtime.

The snapshot contains 270,760 scenes, 498,646 images, 769,643 files, 1,426
performers, and 83 saved filters. Streaming row digests matched across all 65
retained data tables after accounting for table names and equivalent empty
nullable filter fields. Foreign-key checking found zero violations. The private
snapshot, migrated copy, and full comparison receipt are retained locally in
`.local/native-archive-rehearsal-20260930/`; no private library data is committed.

The actual frozen compatible binary was run against an isolated empty native
database and refused schema 1000000 as an unknown legacy fork version. The
native version stayed unchanged. Unit/integration tests also reject foreign
lineage, unsupported versions, missing native tables, unknown legacy objects,
destination collisions, dirty states, and partial SQL promotion.

The full Go unit/integration suite (`GOTOOLCHAIN=auto make it`), SQLite/sharing
integration tests, targeted Go lint, and the retained v3 plugin/current-operation
check passed. `GOTOOLCHAIN=auto make validate-fork` also passed: generation,
frontend lint/types/locales, 527 UI tests in 90 files, all-repository Go lint and
unit/integration tests, and retained native contract checks.

## Canonical saved filters

Migration 1000001 stores ASTs directly on `saved_filters`, removes the live legacy
projection/shadow state, and retains pending alternatives as migration review
evidence. Invalid ASTs fail before conversion; create/update reject invalid or
unserializable criteria without replacing the selected filter. A cleared AST
stays cleared across restart.

The full-copy migration from native 1000000 took 45.6 milliseconds. All 83 filter
ASTs and their name/mode/UI/find options reconciled, 65 other retained tables had
identical streaming row digests, and foreign-key checking found zero violations.
The copied library has no pending legacy filter conflicts. The reconciliation
receipt is `.local/native-archive-rehearsal-20260930/saved-filter-reconciliation.json`.
Focused SQLite/import tests and the complete `make validate-fork` gate passed,
including all 527 frontend tests and retained native contract checks.

## Unified performer names

Migration 1000002 consolidates canonical names, ordered aliases, and per-name
auto-tag policy into `performer_names`. Display names and disambiguation no longer
have to be globally unique. Existing alias selection transfers its policy and
keeps the previous canonical name; database writes replace a name set atomically.
The old name column and both name-related tables are removed. Existing search,
filter, sorting, auto-tag, merge, and anonymised-export callers use the new model.

The full-copy migration took 77.3 milliseconds. All 1,426 performer records,
1,927 names (including 501 aliases), and their policies reconciled. Streaming
digests matched for the other 64 retained tables; foreign-key checking found
zero violations. The receipt is
`.local/native-archive-rehearsal-20260930/performer-name-reconciliation.json`.
Focused migration/domain/API tests and the full validation gate passed.

## Native default filters

Migration 1000003 makes default filters database records with persistent
revisions. A durable configuration checkpoint commits the original filter-only
input, native records, and conflict evidence before atomically publishing the
cleaned config. Generic UI configuration writes cannot bypass the native API;
resolving an alternative requires the revision shown to the reviewer.

Interruption tests cover both publication boundaries, restart, changed inputs,
invalid criteria, preserving edits after import, and stale review actions.
Configuration writes retain permissions and symlinks. Anonymised exports remove
filter evidence and criteria, including freed pages. New database creation no
longer runs old configuration rewrites against modern settings. Pre-migration
backups remain available after success.

The full-copy SQL migration took 31.4 milliseconds; staging and publishing the
nine actual default filters took 20.5 milliseconds. Historical string pagination
was converted without losing sort/display options or the original input. All
66 other retained tables matched by streaming row digest, with zero foreign-key
violations and no pending default conflicts. The receipt is
`.local/native-archive-rehearsal-20260930/default-filter-reconciliation.json`.
The complete `make validate-fork` gate passed, including 528 UI tests, native
contract checks, Go lint, and all Go unit/integration tests.

## Portable archive identities

Migration 1000004 assigns stable UUIDs to performers, scenes, images, and file
records while retaining their integer IDs. Typed foreign keys and partial unique
indexes connect identities to the existing records. Creation, edits, deletion,
and current performer/scene merge callers maintain the identity lifecycle.
Redirects survive merges and subsequent deletion; reused local IDs cannot
resurrect an old identity. Partial merges that leave the source without a UUID
are rejected at commit.

The archive repository supports revision-checked adoption of catalog UUIDs,
preserving generated UUIDs as redirects and refusing conflicting assignments.
It rejects cycles and cross-kind redirects. Anonymised exports replace UUIDs
without breaking the graph. Actual catalog import and API/UI exposure remain
outstanding.

The full-copy migration took 12.6 seconds and created 1,540,475 identities for
1,426 performers, 270,760 scenes, 498,646 images, and 769,643 file records. All
69 retained tables matched by streaming row digest, every existing record had
its identity, and foreign-key checking found zero violations. Database growth
was 249,470,976 bytes (about 238 MiB). The private reconciliation receipt is
`.local/native-archive-rehearsal-20260930/archive-identity-reconciliation.json`.
The full validation gate passed, including migration/lifecycle and merge tests,
anonymised-export checks, 528 UI tests, native contracts, and Go lint/tests.

## Source account foundation

Migration 1000005 adds independent source accounts, qualified identifier claims,
observation evidence, and ownership decisions. Indexed candidate queries retain
reused handles and conflicting IDs for review. Native IDs, handles, and mirror
identifiers remain distinct; matching never assigns media performers. Accounts
and ownership are optional for directly scanned or purchased media.

Evidence replay preserves large numeric identifiers and subsecond timestamps,
extends observation intervals, and rejects changed contents under the same key.
New evidence invalidates stale review revisions. Linked, explicitly unlinked,
and undecided decisions retain immutable history with a checked current head.
Applying a link validates both account and performer revisions. Profile discovery
cannot undo an existing explicit choice. Merge redirects, adopted UUIDs, and
deleted-performer tombstones preserve previous decisions. Anonymised exports
remove source account evidence.

The full-copy migration took 32.6 milliseconds and added 69,632 bytes (68 KiB).
All 70 existing tables, including 1,540,475 archive identities, matched by streaming
row digest, and foreign-key checking found zero violations. New account tables
were empty: schema promotion does not invent provenance for library records.
The private receipt is
`.local/native-archive-rehearsal-20260930/source-account-reconciliation.json`.
The complete `make validate-fork` gate passed: 528 UI tests, current native
contracts, Go lint, and all Go unit/integration tests. Go compilation used
workspace scratch space through `GOTMPDIR` after the shared temporary filesystem
hit its quota; no checks were skipped.
Source equivalence/review services, actual catalog import, and API/UI exposure
are still outstanding. Production remains compatible.

## Physical catalog inventory

The read-only schema inventory on 2026-09-30 found 1,700 databases under the
catalog root: 1,697 schema-3 source catalogs plus the registry, automation, and
run-journal databases. It covers 54 table families and six exact schema variants,
with no unreadable databases after allowing SQLite's transient shared-memory
files. Base database files totalled 2,979,741,696 bytes; this excludes WAL files
and producer state outside the root.

The migration coverage now explicitly includes older plugin profile/binding
tables, collection backfill completions, and one-time backfill policy receipts.
These records must be reconciled with the newer registry and job state rather
than applied twice or used to restart completed work. The private inventory
manifest includes complete schema definitions and per-file schema hashes.
This is an individually consistent schema inventory, not a coordinated backup
boundary or a complete integrity assessment; those remain release requirements.

## Shared source evidence

Migration 1000006 adds portable source posts, shared post revisions and profile
bodies, immutable captures, and checked profile references. Post bodies remain
shared across attachments and meaningful profile edits. Evidence reconstructs
exactly, including large numeric IDs and nanosecond capture times. Versioned
retention removes redundant Reddit renditions and noisy Twitter/Reddit profile
fields for new data; trusted historical import preserves already-retained data.
The 26 synthetic reference fixtures exercise the existing Python policy.

Capture replay is idempotent across restart and rejects changed content under
an existing UUID. Integration tests cover rollback after a late write failure,
cross-post foreign keys, immutable evidence, missing-reference and payload
corruption, bounded indexed queries, and forgotten-post protection. Anonymised
exports remove the new data while preserving the original database. Direct-scan
performer assignments survive migration without invented source posts.
The complete `make validate-fork` gate passed, including 528 UI tests, current
native contracts, Go lint, and all Go unit/integration tests.

The full-copy schema migration took 31.4 milliseconds and added 90,112 bytes
(88 KiB). All 75 retained tables matched by streaming row digest, with zero
foreign-key violations and empty new source tables. The private comparison
receipt is `.local/native-archive-rehearsal-20260930/source-evidence-reconciliation.json`.
An additional read-only inventory covered all 1,697 catalogs: 366,963 observation
records, 430,910 capture-detail records, and 776 separately stored profile bodies.
The largest reconstructed payload size bound was 2,928,259 bytes, below the new
4 MiB limit; no catalog failed inspection. The calculation covers both embedded
and shared profile formats, and deliberately overcounts shared/patch overlap.
It is not a full decode/depth/import validation or a common backup boundary.
Its private receipt is `catalog-evidence-size-inventory.json` in the rehearsal
directory; the all-catalog import rehearsal remains required.
Source-account/capture associations, media appearances, gallery-dl API ingestion,
actual catalog import, and UI exposure remain subsequent work. Production has
not been migrated.

## Source album requirement and gallery identities

The owner's album request is included in the transition plan and acceptance
matrix: one logical gallery per evidenced album post, source attachment order,
mixed images/videos, partial and late downloads, and preservation of manual
choices and existing galleries. Source grouping does not infer performers from
an aggregator. Catalog backfill and standalone export/restore cover albums.

Migration 1000007 gives existing and future galleries portable identities in the
shared registry. Creation, renaming, deletion, UUID adoption, and redirects retain
their semantics; gallery memberships and related metadata advance revisions so
intervening edits invalidate stale review actions. Tests cover existing covers,
image/scene/performer memberships, account links, redirect preservation, deletion,
ID reuse, revision conflicts, and anonymised exports.
The complete `make validate-fork` gate passed, including 528 UI tests, native
contracts, Go lint, and all Go unit/integration tests.

The full-copy migration took 9.56 seconds. All 1,540,475 prior identities and
their UUIDs matched exactly, all 81 other retained tables matched, and all 1,328
existing galleries received identities. Foreign-key checking found no violations.
The rebuild grew the database file by 150,364,160 bytes (143.4 MiB), with
150,929,408 bytes (143.9 MiB) on the reusable free-page list afterward; that space
can serve subsequent native writes. The private receipt is
`.local/native-archive-rehearsal-20260930/gallery-identity-reconciliation.json`.

Source-gallery construction is added in the later checkpoint below; the native
album UI remains required. Ordered attachment associations are described below.
No production galleries or files have been modified.

## Ordered source attachments and media associations

Migration 1000008 adds shared ordered attachment manifests and capture-to-manifest
references. Source order, repeated attachment slots, declared albums, expected
counts, and incomplete source lists survive independently of download state.
Repeated captures share one list; partial captures retain prior snapshots.
Media evidence must cite a capture containing that attachment and typed archive
identities. Observed/verified candidates require an actual current file link.

Selecting media is an audited revision-checked operation. Ingestion can select a
unique supported match; ambiguous candidates require review. Explicit unlinks
survive later evidence. Merge redirects, UUID adoption, deletion tombstones,
restart, keyset pagination, late-write rollback, and anonymisation are covered
by the focused tests. Core/API ingestion must still validate producer evidence;
these repositories are not exposed directly to untrusted producers.

The full-copy schema migration took 54.9 milliseconds. Streaming digests matched
all 82 retained tables, foreign-key checks found zero violations, and all seven
new tables were empty. The database file did not grow because existing free
pages could hold the new schema. The private receipt is
`.local/native-archive-rehearsal-20260930/attachment-reconciliation.json`.
The complete `make validate-fork` gate passed: generation, frontend checks and
528 UI tests, retained native contracts, Go lint, and all Go unit/integration
tests. The previous gallery checkpoint also passed CI lint, build, and preview
image publication.

Source manifest selection and gallery synchronization are described in later
checkpoints below. General field decisions, importer integration, and native UI
remain outstanding.
Production remains on the compatible release.

## Reviewed source-list selection

Migration 1000009 records the selected attachment evidence for each source post.
Compatible partial lists accumulate known positions and counts without erasing
earlier knowledge. A complete capture can replace redundant partial references;
all original captures and earlier decisions remain available. Different IDs at
one position, conflicting known media kinds/counts, and out-of-count positions
produce explicit conflicts rather than a guessed list.

Read-only previews carry the post revision. Applying a choice requires that
revision; pinned and disabled selections survive later captures. Review can
choose a specific capture or explicitly resume automatic selection from it.
Equivalent automatic replay retains the original decision. Bounded bulk queries
load supporting manifests and entries; source payloads are not duplicated.

Focused tests cover accumulation, complete/partial semantics, redundant evidence,
conflicts, stale actions, pin/disable/re-enable, restart/replay, pagination,
late-head failure rollback, cross-post foreign keys, corruption detection,
forgotten posts, migration preservation, and anonymised copies.

The full-copy migration took 45.1 milliseconds. All 89 retained tables matched
by streaming row digest, foreign-key checks found zero violations, and the three
new tables were empty. Existing free pages held the new schema without growing
the file. The private receipt is
`.local/native-archive-rehearsal-20260930/selection-reconciliation.json`.
The complete `make validate-fork` gate passed: generation, frontend validation
and 528 UI tests, retained native
contracts, Go lint, and all Go unit/integration tests. The previous attachment
checkpoint also passed CI lint, build, and preview image publication.

The source-list repository remains separate from gallery synchronization, added
below. Native review API/UI, general field decisions, catalog importer integration,
and the remaining transition phases are still required. Production has not been
migrated.

## Source gallery synchronization and manual membership intent

Migration 1000010 adds explicit gallery origin, audited post-to-gallery choices,
and persistent membership intent. Source synchronization creates one logical
gallery per evidenced album, including partial albums and mixed images/videos.
Repeated slots and reposts reuse existing media. Ordinary single-media posts do
not create galleries. Read-only previews preserve source order and distinguish
unselected, unlinked, deleted, and manually excluded entries; they do not pretend
a linked library entity proves a completed download.

Fresh synchronization replay makes no duplicate galleries, memberships, or audit
events. Manual additions/removals, covers, and deliberately empty metadata survive
later synchronization. Existing manual galleries need an explicit reviewed link;
folder/ZIP galleries cannot be adopted. Disabled associations and deleted galleries
suppress recreation, and gallery redirects require review. No names or titles
establish identity, and source publishers do not become depicted performers.

Repository integration tests cover partial/late media, mixed/repeated/shared
attachments, replay/restart, stale previews, both sides of membership editing,
disable/re-enable, UUID adoption and media redirects, integer-ID reuse, preserved
existing galleries, and atomic rollback after late failures. Anonymised exports
remove association and membership history. Pre-commit and startup guards reject
unfinished source-write context.

The full-copy schema migration took 72.7 milliseconds. All prior columns across
92 retained tables matched by streaming row digest, including every existing
gallery and archive identity. The new gallery-origin values matched the prior
folder/file associations. Foreign-key checking found zero violations, the five
new tables were empty, and the database file did not grow. The private receipt is
`.local/native-archive-rehearsal-20260930/source-gallery-reconciliation.json`.
The complete `make validate-fork` gate passed on the final implementation:
generation, frontend validation and 528 UI tests, native contracts, Go lint,
and all Go unit/integration tests. Existing gallery fixtures now assert their
explicit creation origin. Regression tests also cover reaffirming membership
through scene/image add operations and file associations without a primary file.

The native API/UI, per-field source/review policies, manual mixed-media ordering,
durable after-success delivery, and producer/catalog import integration remain
required. This checkpoint initializes new album title/description/date and
preserves all existing gallery metadata. Production has not been migrated.

## Portable metadata relationship targets

Migration 1000011 adds tag, studio, and group UUIDs to the archive registry. They
retain identity across renames and preserve tombstones after deletion or reuse
of an integer ID. Tag merges retain redirects to the surviving tag while moving
the existing aliases, remote IDs, and media relationships. Definition and
hierarchy edits advance revisions; moving a relation invalidates both owners.
These identities are a prerequisite for typed references in metadata history,
not an implementation of field decisions themselves.

Focused tests cover all three kinds, stale revisions, UUID adoption, redirects,
transaction rollback, indexed lookup, relationship edits, existing source-gallery
references, and anonymised exports. The full-copy migration took 10.28 seconds.
All 1,541,803 prior identities matched exactly, all 96 other retained tables
matched by streaming row digest, and all 118 tags, 124 studios, and five groups
received identities. Foreign-key checking found zero violations. File growth
was 1,642,496 bytes, with 146,558,976 bytes available on the reusable free-page
list. The private receipt is
`.local/native-archive-rehearsal-20260930/metadata-identity-reconciliation.json`.
The complete `make validate-fork` gate passed, including generation, frontend
validation and 528 UI tests, native contracts, Go lint, and all Go unit/integration
tests. Production has not been migrated.

## Scalar metadata choices

Migration 1000012 introduces set, clear, and inherit for curated scene/image/gallery
scalar fields. Existing values, including empty ones, remain protected until
reviewed. Their prior values enter history on the first edit, avoiding a copy of
every entity or a separate initial row for every field. Ordinary edits record
library intent in the database. An explicit empty title survives later source
and filename suggestions, and filename fallback cannot replace a nonempty
source title. New albums retain the capture provenance of their initial fields.

Focused tests cover typed targets, date precision, invalid inputs, canonical
integer round trips, clear/inherit/replay, stale revisions, ordinary same-value
edits, lazy legacy history, adoption and deletion/ID reuse, indexed pagination,
scope and immutability constraints, late rollback, startup refusal, and removal
of private history from anonymised exports. The initial full gate caught two
unused test-result assignments; the tests now assert those results. Broader album
tests also caught and corrected a query that treated revision metadata as a
standalone column rather than reading its JSON member.

The full-copy migration took 1.62 seconds. Streaming comparison matched all 97
retained tables, and all 770,734 existing scene/image/gallery identities received
a preservation baseline. No decisions were fabricated during migration.
Foreign-key checking found zero violations; the database file did not grow, with
110,927,872 bytes remaining on its reusable free-page list. The private receipt
is `.local/native-archive-rehearsal-20260930/metadata-fields-reconciliation.json`.
Existing selected text fields were also checked against the scalar value bound.
The final complete `make validate-fork` gate passed: generation, frontend
validation and 528 UI tests, retained native contracts, Go lint with zero issues,
and all Go unit/integration tests.

Relationship choices, policy/source resolution, native API/UI and creation-intent
conversion, importer/producer integration, and durable after-success delivery
remain required. This checkpoint does not enable automatic rescanning or overwrite
existing album headers. Production has not been migrated.

## Collection and relationship metadata choices

Migration 1000013 adds the same set/clear/inherit behavior to performers, tags,
studio, URLs, custom fields, and scene groups. Relationship decisions retain
normalized UUID references, with reviewed target revisions and immutable sealed
history. Performer/tag merges preserve the meaning of historical associations;
deleting a target cannot silently rebind old history when its integer ID is
reused. Native browsing fields remain the selected state.

Ordinary bulk edits retain the previous value and record one final choice per
field at commit. Explicit empty sets and reaffirming existing relationships also
protect user intent. SQL guards, transaction checks, and startup validation reject
unfinished decisions. The existing scalar history survives migration intact.
Anonymised exports remove the added references and transaction state.

Focused tests cover every field type across scenes/images/galleries, target
revision conflicts, wrong-kind references, coalescing, clear/inherit/replay,
empty updates through existing APIs, merge/adoption/delete/ID reuse, previous
values without recorded history, preserved history sequence counters, late
rollback, startup refusal, and indexed lookup. Numeric tests include large
doubles and exact signed 64-bit integers, including writes after replay. The
query-plan test identified a missing scene-to-group index, which is
included in this migration. Full-copy probing found no full scans for selected
metadata lookups; a representative single studio edit took about one millisecond.
Existing relationship sizes were within the 4096-target bound.

The final full-copy schema migration took 2.30 seconds. Streaming row digests
matched all 101 retained tables and columns, with zero foreign-key violations.
The new reference and pending tables were empty, no provenance was invented, and
the file did not grow; 110,845,952 bytes remained available on its free-page list.
The private receipt is
`.local/native-archive-rehearsal-20260930/metadata-collections-reconciliation.json`.

The complete `make validate-fork` gate passed on the final code: generation,
frontend validation and 528 UI tests, the retained v3 extension contract and
71 application operation files, Go lint with zero issues, and all Go unit and
integration tests. The SQLite suite completed in 402.1 seconds.

Source/policy resolution, native review API/UI, creation-intent conversion,
producer/catalog import integration, and durable after-success delivery remain
required. Production has not been migrated.

## Reviewed source-account consolidation

Migration 1000014 adds explicit consolidation of duplicate account records in
one service namespace. Original account UUIDs, identifier evidence, and ownership
history remain available. Canonical account and identifier indexes follow the
surviving record through checked foreign keys, including after nested merges.
Lookup remains indexed and paginated instead of traversing redirect chains.

A preview covers the selected account components and their current performer
revisions. Compatible ownership choices can be retained; contradictory ownership
requires an explicit resulting choice. Conflicting stable IDs require a separate
acknowledgement and stay in the evidence. Cross-service and native/mirror accounts
remain distinct, and consolidation does not assign depicted performers to media.
An optional operation UUID provides exact replay without duplicate history.
Transaction/startup guards reject unfinished work, and anonymised exports remove
the added private history.

Focused tests cover retained identifiers and local ownership history, canonical
lookups and query plans, nested consolidation, stale identity and performer
reviews, explicit unlink preservation, conflict resolution, replay, rollback,
startup refusal, anonymisation, and migration with existing decisions. Fixtures
exercise Reddit, Twitter, Instagram, Bluesky, TikTok, Patreon, OnlyFans, Fansly,
Coomer/Kemono namespaces, and an unfamiliar extractor. A regression fixture also
requires acknowledgement before consolidating conflicting TikTok `secUid`
claims. Review bounds are 4096 account records and 8192 identifiers.

The full-copy migration took 1.054 seconds. Streaming comparisons matched all
103 retained tables and columns, with zero foreign-key violations. The new
consolidation/context tables were empty, and every existing account began as its
own canonical identity. No links were inferred and the database file did not
grow, with 110,796,800 bytes remaining on its reusable free-page list. The private
receipt is
`.local/native-archive-rehearsal-20260930/account-consolidation-reconciliation.json`.
The Stash copy has no imported source accounts yet; populated migration fixtures
separately verify existing identifiers and ownership choices.

The final complete `make validate-fork` gate passed: generation, frontend
validation and all 528 UI tests, retained v3 extension contracts and 71 application
operation files, Go lint with zero issues, and all Go unit/integration tests.
The SQLite suite completed in 450.9 seconds. An earlier run exhausted the shared
temporary-files quota during linking; both Go build and linker temporary files
were redirected to the workspace disk for successful validation.

Producer evidence matching, native account-review API/UI, and catalog import
remain required integration work. Production has not been migrated.

## Captured account identity extraction

Core now implements `captured-account-v1` for deriving qualified identifier claims
from reconstructed gallery-dl/yt-dlp captures. Each claim retains its source JSON
pointer and evidence basis. The parser preserves exact numeric IDs and handles
Reddit parent context, Twitter, Instagram, Bluesky, TikTok (including `secUid`),
Tumblr, native subscription services, Coomer/Kemono, and unfamiliar extractors.
It leaves missing IDs unresolved and reports malformed claims for review.

Mirror user IDs and matching public identifiers retain the mirror/service
namespace; display labels do not become native handles. Directory names, scraper
target URLs, and unrelated feed-owner profiles cannot establish the publisher's
ID. A generic extractor's display name remains a label. Existing legacy links
and handle-only inventory records still require lossless import independently
of whether the parser can derive new claims.

Focused fixtures cover these service shapes, exact integers above 2^53, duplicate
keys and malformed identifiers, replay, immutable input bytes, irrelevant profile
noise, retained-payload equivalence, and missing/mismatched mirror profiles.
The complete `make validate-fork` gate passed on this code with the consolidation
checkpoint: 528 UI tests, native contracts, zero Go lint issues, and every Go
unit/integration package. No database migration is required for this parser.

See [native source identity](native-source-identity.md) for the contract and
evidence limits. Account resolution, publisher associations, ingestion/import
integration, and review API/UI remain required. The parser does not create
accounts, merge candidates, change ownership, or assign depicted performers.
