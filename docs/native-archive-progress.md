# Native archive implementation progress

This is the implementation record for the
[full transition plan](native-archive-transition-plan.md). It does not narrow
that plan's scope or replace its completion criteria. Development remains on
`v3-rewrite`; merge into `develop` requires verification and the owner's success
review. Production has not been migrated.

## Frozen baseline

- Stash source: `0a603d07e9ec3dd9863a7340858a635525bb2c11`, pushed annotated tag
  `v2.5-compatible-final`; primary schema 86, fork schema 9.
- The running binary reports `v0.26.2-1182-g0a603d07e`. Its wrapper index is
  `sha256:b9c30164d591cb9764f809505208fbf7d42d0bfdf209230b94f0dba69b46014b`.
- The local Quadlet now uses that digest and has registry auto-update disabled.
  A daemon reload succeeded; the existing container was not restarted. The
  original Quadlet is retained in the owner's config backup directory under
  `backups/native-archive-baseline-20260930/`.
- The [release manifest](releases/v2.5-compatible-final.json) records all frozen
  image digests. Base-image preservation passed in
  [run 36757532460](https://github.com/notsafeforgit/stash/actions/runs/36757532460),
  including embedded revision and exact manifest-digest checks. Wrapper image
  preservation passed in
  [run 36758167764](https://github.com/notsafeforgit/stash-s6/actions/runs/36758167764)
  for all three variants and their child manifests.

## Incremental implementation

| Repository / commit | Work and evidence |
| --- | --- |
| Stash `781ee4b93` | Full transition plan and documentation links |
| Stash `b76c600a8` | Frozen release manifest, non-overwriting preservation script, child-manifest retention, isolated native preview tags; seven safety tests and actionlint passed |
| stash-s6 `5dab164` | Explicit digest selection for native builds, isolated preview variants, preservation workflow using pinned Stash release tooling; actionlint and [resolved bake validation](https://github.com/notsafeforgit/stash-s6/actions/runs/36757903303) passed |

## Phase status

| Phase | Status |
| --- | --- |
| 0 Baseline and contract | In progress: source tagged, runtime pinned, all compatible images preserved, independent-fork policy updated. Full backup boundary, fixtures, scoped API contract and performance budgets remain. |
| 1 Native schema and services | Not yet implemented |
| 2 Ingestion and producer adapter | Not yet implemented |
| 3 Catalog importer and full-copy reconciliation | Not yet implemented |
| 4 Native UI and client conversion | Not yet implemented |
| 5 Compatibility removal and packaging | Preview packaging isolated; runtime/build conversion remains |
| 6 Backup and cutover rehearsal | Not yet implemented |
| 7 Production cutover | Not started; compatible production continues |
| 8 Retirement and acceptance | Not started |

No live catalog data or Stash schema has been changed. Do not retire existing
writers, mounts, plugin data, or backups until rehearsal and cutover requirements
have passed. Original catalogs and operating state are migration inputs, including
performer merges, UUIDs, explicit unlink decisions, and pending producer work.
