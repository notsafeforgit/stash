# Native schema promotion

The independent schema begins at primary migration 1000000 and identifies itself
with `native_schema.lineage = org.notsafeforgit.stash.native-archive`. New
databases use this lineage. Existing compatible databases require explicit
migration; normal startup does not silently promote them.

Before a writable migration connection opens, a read-only inspection rejects
dirty migration state, a foreign or missing native marker, newer native schemas,
unsupported legacy primary/fork versions, and missing authoritative native
tables. The native version is distinct from both upstream's 1–86 input sequence
and historical private schemas 998/999. Production deployment must still use a
separate native database path; a marker cannot teach arbitrary future upstream
binaries about this fork.

Promotion completes the legacy fork migrations and their final reconciliation
once, snapshots existing migration history before any historical compaction,
checks foreign keys, and rejects unknown `fork_*` objects or destination-table
collisions. A single SQL transaction establishes the lineage, preserves history
in `legacy_schema_history`, and promotes the authoritative tables:

| Compatible table | Native table |
| --- | --- |
| `fork_video_file_metadata` | `video_file_metadata` |
| `fork_image_file_metadata` | `image_file_metadata` |
| `fork_scene_cover_sources` | `scene_cover_sources` |
| `fork_shares` | `shares` |
| `fork_share_sessions` | `share_sessions` |
| `fork_file_deletions` | `file_deletions` |
| `fork_saved_filter_state` | `saved_filter_state` (transitional canonical-model input) |
| `fork_performer_autotag_ignored_names` | `performer_autotag_ignored_names` (transitional canonical-model input) |

Rows retain their IDs, checksums, source validity information, historical deleted
file IDs, share tokens/snapshots, and foreign-key behavior. The large scene/image
covering indexes retain their historical names to avoid unnecessary rebuilding.
Repositories and filter joins use the promoted table names. The active fork
migration ledger is removed and legacy migrators cannot modify a native schema.

Migration 1000001 validates and moves each saved-filter AST onto
`saved_filters.filter_ast`, then removes `object_filter` and `saved_filter_state`
in one transaction. The repository reads and writes that single representation.
Invalid ASTs stop conversion before the old state is changed. Existing pending
legacy conflicts retain their exact input strings in `saved_filter_import_conflicts`
for review; the canonical AST stays selected. This evidence survives deletion of
the saved filter. `native_migration_history` records each native conversion.

Legacy filter files can still be converted at the import boundary while their
remaining callers are retired. They do not create live projection/shadow data.
Default-filter configuration promotion, unified performer names, archive UUIDs,
source/provenance models, and the catalog import are separate remaining work.
The full [transition plan](native-archive-transition-plan.md) remains the
acceptance requirement.

The filesystem deletion journal currently derives its directory from the
database filename. Promotion in place retains that association, but a production
path change must first drain pending deletions or transfer the exact journal
with its database. Do not rename a live database and assume its pending file
operations moved with it.

Migrations run against copies during development. SQL failure leaves a dirty
migration state that startup refuses; restore the migration backup or use a
validated recovery procedure. Do not force a schema version to hide a failure.
The compatible database and deployment stay pinned until the production cutover
and restore gates pass.
